                <h2>EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</h2>
                Adele Laurie Blue Adkins  was born on 5 May 1988 in the Tottenham district of London, to an English mother, Penny Adkins, and a Welsh father, Marc Evans.[10] After Evans left when Adele was 2, she was brought up by her mother.[11][12] She began singing at age 4 and asserts that she became obsessed with voices.[13][14] In 1997, 9-year-old Adele and her mother, who by then had found work as a furniture maker and an adult-learning activities organiser, relocated to Brighton on the south coast of England.[15]
                
                In 1999, Adele and her mother moved back to London; first to Brixton, then to the neighbouring district of West Norwood in south London, which is the subject of her first song "Hometown Glory".[16] Adele spent much of her youth in Brockwell Park where she would play the guitar and sing to friends, which she recalled in her 2015 song "Million Years Ago". She stated, "It has quite monumental moments of my life that I've spent there, and I drove past it [in 2015] and I just literally burst into tears. I really missed it."[17] Adele graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon in May 2006,[18] where she was a classmate of Leona Lewis and Jessie J.[9][19] Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent[20] even though, at the time, she was more interested in going into artists and repertoire (A&R) and hoped to launch other people's careers.[9]

                <h2>Adele’s Albums at ‘19’ (2008)</h2>
                Adele’s debut album, 19, which is named for the singer's age when she began recording the project, went on sale in early 2008. Led by two popular lead singles, "Hometown Glory" and "Chasing Pavements," the record rocketed Adele to fame.
        
                Released in the United States through Columbia Records, 19 resonated with American audiences, much as it had with British music fans. Adele cemented her commercial success with an appearance in October 2008 on Saturday Night Live. At the taping of the show, the album was ranked No. 40 on iTunes. Less than 24 hours later, it was No. 1.
                After graduating in arts from the BRIT School in 2006,[4] Adele signed a record deal with XL Recordings. Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 and included the UK top-five singles "Chasing Pavements" and "Make You Feel My Love". 19 has sold over 2.5 million copies in the UK and was named in the top 20 best-selling debut albums of all time in the UK.[5][6] She was honoured with the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Adele released her second studio album, 21, in 2011. It became the world's best-selling album of the 21st century, with sales of over 31 million. 21 holds the record for the top-performing album in US chart history, topping the Billboard 200 for 24 weeks, with the singles "Rolling in the Deep", "Someone like You", and "Set Fire to the Rain" heading charts worldwide, becoming her signature songs. The album received a record-tying six Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. In 2012, Adele released "Skyfall", a soundtrack single for the James Bond film Skyfall, which won her the Academy Award for Best Original

                <h3>At 21</h3>
                <p> Adele’s much-anticipated follow-up album, 21, again named for her age at the time of recording, did not disappoint upon its release in early 2011. Tapping even deeper into Adele's appreciation for classic American R&B and jazz, the record was a monster hit, selling 352,000 copies within its first week.
                    Anchored by hits like "Rolling in the Deep" and "Someone Like You," 21 placed Adele in rarified air. In February 2011, she found herself with two Top 5 singles and a pair of Top 5 albums in the same week, becoming the only artist besides the Beatles and 50 Cent to achieve that milestone. And with 21 staying at No. 1 for 11 weeks, Adele also broke the solo female artist record previously held by Madonna's Immaculate Collection for consecutive weeks atop the album charts. 21 went on to sell more than 30 million copies worldwide.

                <h3>At 25</h3>
                <p>On October 22, 2015, Adele announced that she would release her third album, 25, in November. She posted 25's cover on Instagram, and said of her first full-length studio project in several years: "My last record was a break-up record, and if I had to label this one, I would call it a make-up record. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. 25 is about getting to know who I've become without realizing. And I'm sorry it took so long but, you know, life happened."
                   
                   25, released in November 2015, is a collection of emotional, sometimes plaintive songs looking at the ins and outs of relationships, owing much of its sound to traditional pop craft. The album went on to become an international smash hit, reaching No. 1 on iTunes in 110 countries. In the U.S., 25 sold 3.38 million copies in seven days, beating the 'NSync record of 2.42 million album copies sold in a week. Among other feats, 25 is also the only album to reach a million copies sold in the United States in 10 days.
                   The album broke first-week sales records in the UK and US. In the US, it remains the only album to sell over three million copies in a week. 25 earned her five Grammy Awards, including the Album of the Year. The lead single, "Hello", achieved huge success worldwide. Her fourth studio album, 30, released in 2021, contains the chart-topping and Grammy-winning single "Easy on Me". 25 and 30 became the best-selling albums worldwide, including the US and the UK, in 2015 and 2021, respectively. As of 2023, all of her studio albums, except 19, have topped the yearly best-selling albums chart worldwide in the 21st century.

                <h3>At 30</h3>
                <p> On November 19, 2021, Adele released her fourth album 30.
                    Adele was reportedly working on her fourth studio album by 2018.[174] On 5 May 2019, her 31st birthday, Adele posted several black-and-white pictures of herself on her Instagram account celebrating the occasion along with a message reflecting on the preceding year. The message ended with, "30 will be a drum n bass record to spite you". Media outlets took the post as an indication that a new album was on the way.[175][176] On 15 February 2020, Adele announced at a friend's wedding that her fourth studio album would be out by September 2020.[177] However, she later confirmed that the album's production and release had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[178] Adele made her first television appearance in almost four years by hosting the 24 October 2020 episode of Saturday Night Live, with musical guest H.E.R.[179]

                    <h2>Grammy Awards</h2>
                    <P>
                        Adele has been nominated for 18 Grammys and won a total of 15 at the awards ceremonies in 2009, 2012 and 2017. She also received a songwriting Oscar for the James Bond track "Skyfall."
            
                    At the 2009 Grammy awards, Adele took home Best New Artist. In addition, the album earned the singer the distinction of being named the "Sound of 2008" by the BBC. That same year, she earned the Critics' Choice prize at the BRIT Awards.
            
                    In 2012, Adele swept the Grammy Awards, taking home six wins, including Album of the Year. "This record is inspired by something that is really normal and everyone's been through it—just a rubbish relationship," she said at the ceremony.
                    In 2013, Adele won her seventh Grammy (Best Pop Solo Performance) for her hit single "Set Fire to the Rain." That same year, the singer won a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for "Skyfall," the theme song for the 2013 James Bond film of the same name.
            
                    In 2016, Adele performed the ballad "All I Ask," co-written by Bruno Mars, on the 58th Annual Grammy Awards while dealing with technical glitches from the accompanying piano.
            
                    In 2017, Adele returned to the Grammy stage and had to stop her tribute to the late George Michael, a slowed down version of his song "Fastlove," and start over, saying: "I'm sorry — I can’t mess this up for him." She went on to sing the song to a standing ovation. She then swept the awards with five wins for her work on 25, including album, record and song of the year, as well as Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. With her historic wins, Adele became the first artist in Grammy history to sweep the top three categories twice.
                    In her acceptance speech for album of the year, she acknowledged fellow nominee Beyoncé and her groundbreaking album Lemonade. “But my artist of my life is Beyoncé, and this album for me, the Lemonade album, was just so monumental," she said.

                     <h2>HUSBAND AND CHILD</h2>
                     <p>
                        In 2011, Adele met her former partner Simon Konecki, who is 13 years her senior and the founder of Life water and the charity Drop4Drop. On June 29, 2012, Adele announced on her website that she was pregnant with the couple’s first child. She spoke to People magazine about being a mother: "I really want to be a mum. I better start getting on with it!" she said. She gave birth to her son Angelo on October 19, 2012.
            
                        In early 2017, Adele was spotted wearing a wedding band, sparking marriage rumors. At her January 2017 Grammy acceptance speech, Adele appeared to confirm the rumors by calling Konecki her husband. “Grammys, I appreciate it, the Academy, I love you, my manager, my husband and my son – you’re the only reason I do it,” she said at the time. Although in interviews backstage she referred to Konecki as her “partner,” she confirmed her marriage in March during a concert in Brisbane, Australia.
                        In 2015, Adele said, "I'm a feminist, I believe that everyone should be treated the same, including race and sexuality".[238] Supportive of the LGBT community, on 12 June 2016, an emotional Adele dedicated her show in Antwerp, Belgium, to the victims of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, United States, earlier that day, adding, "The LGBTQ community, they're like my soul mates since I was really young, so I'm very moved by it."[277][278]
